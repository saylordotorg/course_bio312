Course Syllabus for "BIO312: Evolutionary Biology"
--------------------------------------------------

One of the best ways to understand the present is to understand the
past. Evolutionary Biology is the study of the changes in life forms
over time - changes that have occurred over millions of years as well as
those that have occurred over just a few decades. In this course, we
will look at the various mechanisms of evolution, how these mechanisms
work, and how change is measured. The concepts you learn in this course
will serve as a foundation for studying fossil records and current
classification schemes in biology. We will begin the course by reviewing
the evolutionary concepts of selection and speciation. We will then
learn to measure evolutionary change through comparisons with the
Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium, to understand the process of change through
Game Theory, and to interpret and classify changes by creating
phylogenies. The course will wrap up with a look at the history of life
according to the fossil record and a discussion of the broad range of
life forms as they are currently classified. At the end of this course,
you will have a better understanding of the evolution of life. Also,
this course will prepare you for future study and research in
macroevolution, microevolution, genetics, anthropology, zoology, botany,
behavioral biology, and computational biology.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:  

-   define evolution and describe different types of selection;
-   define Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and demonstrate the
    problem-solving use of the theory in population genetics studies of
    natural populations;
-   provide examples of the mechanisms of evolution and describe how
    they impact the genetic makeup of populations;
-   provide examples of games used in evolutionary game theory and
    connect biological phenomena to the game theory;
-   develop simple phylogenies from molecular or morphological data;
-   identify important evolutionary events that have occurred throughout
    Earth’s geological history, starting with the hypotheses on the
    origin of life;
-   characterize and provide examples of the major plant and animal
    phyla and identify important evolutionary novelties in the main
    clades of the tree of life; and
-   demonstrate the knowledge of human evolutionary history and identify
    the key events in human evolution.

### Course Information

Welcome to BIO312: Evolutionary Biology. General information on this
course and its requirements can be found below.  
  
 **Course Designer**: Kristian Demary, Ph.D.  
  
 **Primary Resources**: This course is composed of a range of different
free, online materials. However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:  

-   Open Yale Courses: Stephen C. Stearns’ [Principles of Evolution,
    Ecology and
    Behavior](http://oyc.yale.edu/ecology-and-evolutionary-biology/eeb-122)
-   [Kimball’s Biology
    pages](http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/)
-   University of California, Berkeley: [Evolution
    101](http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosite/evo101/index.shtml)
-   iTunes: Illinois Springfield: [Evolution: Prof. James
    Bonacum](http://itunes.apple.com/itunes-u/evolution/id430684908)

**Requirements for Completion**: In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials:
readings, lectures, web media, interactive labs, and assignments. You
will also need to complete the following:  

-   Interactive Lab: “The Virtual Stickelback Evolution Lab”
-   Interactive Lab: “Forces of Evolution”
-   Assessment: “Hardy-Weinberg”
-   Interactive lab 1: “Forces of Evolution, pt. 2”
-   Activity: “The Evolution of Interspecific Mutualism”
-   Activity: “Wolf Sheep Stride Inheritance”
-   Assignment: “Molecular Biology and Phylogeny”
-   Assessment: “Phylogeny”
-   Interactive Lab: “Radioactive Dating Game”
-   Activity: Taxonomy of Various Groups of Organisms
-   The Final Exam

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam.
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the assignments and the interactive lab listed above.  
 In order to *pass* this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the final exam. Your score will be tabulated as soon as the exam has
been completed. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
  
 **Time Commitment**: Completing this course should take you a total
of **67 hours**. Please note that each unit has its own time advisory.
This will help you better manage your time.
