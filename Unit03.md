title: "BIO312: Evolutionary Biology"
course_description: "An examination of the processes through which the current forms of life have arisen. Topics include: the mechanisms of evolution, measures of evolutionary change, current framings of evolutionary changes (e.g. Game Theory), and phylogenies."

**Unit 3: Evolutionary Game Theory** <span id="3"></span> 
*Game Theory is a mathematic representation of inputs and responses
often used in psychology to predict behavior. Game Theory can also
predict coevolutionary change. In this unit, we will look at how Game
Theory can be used in evolutionary biology and practice using it in
hypothetical situations. The activity in this unit will involve an
assignment or simulation in which you will be required to calculate
inputs and responses and use those calculations to make predictions or
to draw conclusions.*

**Unit 3 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take you approximately 14 hours.

**Unit3 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:
-   explain how game theory applies to evolutionary biology;
-   compare and contrast cooperative and non-cooperative games;
-   define the *prisoner’s dilemma* and give an example of this concept
    from evolutionary biology;
-   define evolutionary arms race and give an example; and
-   explain how the Red Queen Hypothesis relates to evolutionary biology
    and give an example of this.
