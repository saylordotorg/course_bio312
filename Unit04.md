**Unit 4: Speciation, Classification, and Phylogeny** <span
id="4"></span> 
*At this point, you should have an understanding of how evolutionary
changes and speciation occur, but how do scientists learn about the past
evolutionary history of a species or another taxonomic group? In this
unit, we will look at the methods that biologists use to create and
reconstruct phylogenies (family trees of species). We will then look at
some example phylogenies and practice creating our own. A main student
activity in this unit will involve an assignment/ simulation, in which
you will be required to estimate the distance between the species and
create a phylogeny.*

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take you approximately 15 hours.

**4.1 How Is a Phylogeny Created?** <span id="4.1"></span> 
*Note: A phylogeny is created by comparing characteristics among species
and calculating the number of differences in order to determine likely
evolutionary relationships. The process of creating phylogenies often
relies on parsimony, or the assumption that the least number of
evolutionary changes (both divergence and convergence in characters) is
a most likely scenario in the history of the lineages. But among all the
possible measurable characteristics of a species, which are compared?
Morphological phylogenies compare the physical or developmental
characteristics of species, while molecular phylogenies compare the DNA
sequences such as microsatellites (known areas of repeating sections
within the genome, subject to relatively rapid change due to mutations)
or other molecular data. In this subunit, we will discuss and show
examples of both.*

**4.1.1 Morphological** <span id="4.1.1"></span> 
*Note: Phylogenies based on morphological traits identify the
synapomorhies, or the shared derived traits that are found in the most
recent common ancestor and all of the taxons in a group.Such traits
define a monophyletic group in the phylogenetic tree. This topic is
covered in the reading in section 4.2.*

**4.1.2 Molecular** <span id="4.1.2"></span> 
*Note: Phylogenies based on molecular data (such as nucleotide
sequences) compare molecular homologiesamong species.*

     Instructions: Follow the instructions on this lesson plan to begin
    constructing your own phylogeny or a cladogram, based on
    morphological traits. Pick a group of animals you would like to
    compare: you can identify a group of species to compare (using the
    web or an encyclopedia), and select a few traits you will focus on
    in your comparison. For example, you could compare species based on
    the skull shape, femur length, and/or number of phalanges
    (fingers and toes). Use the handouts provided on this page,
    which will walk you through creating your own cladogram based on the
    selected traits.

**4.3.2 Molecular Evolution** <span id="4.3.2"></span> 
*Molecular evolution is based on using biomolecules to
reconstruct evolutionary history and understand the relations between
different taxa.* *Based on the both molecular and morphological data,
evolutionary biologists can construct phylogenetic trees. Molecular
traits such as DNA, RNA or protein sequences are often used in the
modern taxonomy. Phylogeny is very important because many biological
phenomena of interest can be modeled as bifurcating processes.
Phylogenetic analysis has many other applications, beyond Biology. For
instance, it could be used to solve criminal cases, such as the one
described in the reading below.*
