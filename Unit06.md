title: "BIO312: Evolutionary Biology"
course_description: "An examination of the processes through which the current forms of life have arisen. Topics include: the mechanisms of evolution, measures of evolutionary change, current framings of evolutionary changes (e.g. Game Theory), and phylogenies."

**Unit 6: Current Taxonomy** <span id="6"></span> 
*We will study the six kingdoms of life and the common characteristics
of each taxonomic group. In greater detail, we will look at the array of
plant and animal life and their classification into phyla and classes.
The main phylogeny of life shows that Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya are
the tree domains of life, categories higher than kingdoms. The lineages
of Bacteria and Archaea are both prokaryotes and while very different,
they help us understand how the last and perhaps most recent, common
ancestor of all life (LUCA) was indeed a simple prokaryote. Domain
Eukarya is the best known and comprise different kingdoms of organisms,
all with a membrane bound nucleus and organelles. Such kingdoms are
Protista, Plantae, Fungi and Animalia.*

**Unit6 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:
-   list and describe the three Domains of life;
-   list and describe the five Kingdoms of life;
-   list the major characteristics of the nine animal phyla from the
    readings;
-   compare and contrast the characteristics of prokaryotes and
    eukaryotes;
-   compare and contrast the characteristics of plants and animals; and
-   compare and contrast the characteristics of nonvascular, seedless
    plants with vascular seed plants.

**6.1 Kingdoms** <span id="6.1"></span> 
*Systematics and classification (or taxonomy) of living and non-living
things around us has its origins in times of Greek philosophers, such as
Aristotle and Plato. Their writings led to what was known, for centuries
to follow, as the Natural History, as well as to Carolus Linneaus’
hierarchal classification system (18<sup>th</sup> century), which we
still use today. However, modern classification is based on the
evolutionary history and coherent scientific hypotheses and methods.
Below you will find a brief introduction into major taxonomical
groups/kingdoms of life on Earth.*
