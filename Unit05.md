**Unit 5: The Fossil Record** <span id="5"></span> 
*Using fossil evidence as well as the physical, chemical and
phylogenetic data, scientists have reconstructed history of life on
Earth and learned that it extends back many millennia. In this unit, we
will learn more about how scientists find and use fossil evidence, as
well as how evolutionary changes coincide with geographical changes in
the Earth. We will then learn the major species radiations and other
occurrences in the evolutionary history, as described on the Geologic
Time Scale. *

**Unit 5 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take you approximately 6.5 hours.

**5.1.2 Obstacles** <span id="5.1.2"></span> 
*Note: Despite of the importance of fossils in reconstructing
evolutionary history of life, scientists also need many other types of
evidence. The fossil record alone poses many obstacles, such as the fact
that only some organisms could be preserved in the fossil record, while
transitional fossils are missing or incomplete.*

**5.3 Biogeography** <span id="5.3"></span> 
*Note: The abiotic features of an environment have a profound effect on
the evolution of the species that live there. Geographical features, for
example, affect population migration routes, availability of resources,
and ease of access to those resources. Imagine that, over time, a
mountain range or large body of water has developed in what was once the
continuous range of species. A subpopulation on one side of the
environmental feature is now much less likely to interbreed with
subpopulation on the other side. Over time, genetic drift alone is
likely to cause divergence and perhaps speciation between the
subpopulations. On the other hand, development of a land bridge between
two isolated territories may create the opposite effect. Changes in
geographical features can even cause changes in the climate, as they can
affect wind currents and the evaporation-precipitation cycle. Due to
these and other climate changes, some species may go extinct, while
others may become more competitive, and still others may survive through
newly evolved adaptations. In this subunit, we will discuss some
specific ways that biogeography can affect evolution.*
