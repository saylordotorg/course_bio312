**Unit 7: Human Evolution** <span id="7"></span> 
*The origin and evolution of man are to some the most interesting, but
also a controversial part of the evolutionary biology. As you will see
in the lectures below, human evolution could be traced from the early
Eutherian (Placental mammals) to the origin of primates, great apes and
finally hominins. Based on the comprehensive studies in paleobiology,
anthropology, anatomy and phylogenetic analysis, we have learned that
modern humans (Homo sapiens) have a long lineage of ancestral species,
dating to the first bipedal hominins, four million years ago. Homo
sapiens appear in the record only around 100,000 years ago and it is the
only surviving species of this lineage. Extensive studies of the DNA
sequences show that humans are most closely related to chimpanzees and
belong in the same broader clade with gorillas. The last recent common
ancestor of today’s chimps and humans probably lived in Africa, about 7
million years ago.*

**Unit7 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:
-   describe the evidence for human evolution;
-   compare and contrast characteristic of modern humans and present
    living great apes;
-   explain the evidence for the evolution of bipedalism;
-   describe the main lineages in the human evolutionary history; and
-   analyze the scientific debate about the origins of Homo sapiens.
