**Unit 8: Appendix** <span id="8"></span> 
*Although we live in a secular culture of the 21<sup>st</sup> century,
for some people evolution creates an argument against religion and even
some philosophical views. However, a number of scholars write that our
knowledge of evolution, including the human evolution, does not have to
be counteractive towards religious views and beliefs.  Thus as an
appendix to this course, we would like to offer several excellent
resources from the highly acknowledged scientists and philosophers of
science. *
