**Unit 1: Review of Concepts** <span id="1"></span> 
*In this unit, we will review the important conceptual underpinnings of
evolutionary biology. We will learn definitions of important terms such
as evolution, selection, and species. We will also learn the mechanisms
of evolutionary change and speciation. You learned the majority of this
material in the introductory course BIO102: Evolutionary and Ecological
Biology, so much of this unit will serve as a review. Upon completion of
this unit, you should have a solid understanding of evolutionary
theory.*

**Unit 1 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take you approximately 12 hours.

    the evolutionary history of stickleback fish. We recommend that you

     The three-spine stickleback is a model organism for studying
    evolution, combining data from molecular genetics, field biology,
    and natural history, including fossils. The ancestral forms of
    stickleback fish are small ocean   dwellers that sport heavy armor
    in the form of bony plates and spines projecting from the back and
    pelvis. This armor protects ocean sticklebacks from predatory
    attacks. Some species of sticklebacks are anadromous and, like
    salmon, travel from the ocean via rivers to spawn in freshwater
    lakes. At the end of the last ice age, some stickleback populations
    became trapped in lakes that were cut off from the ocean in the wake
    of retreating ice fields. In the past 20,000 to 10,000 years,
    these stranded populations evolved dramatically over generations, as
    they adapted to living permanently in a freshwater environment.

     Instructions: Read this article.  
      
     Notice that when individuals from populations with different
    allele frequencies mix, the combined population will be
    in **H-W **equilibrium after one generation of random mating. The
    combined population will be out of equilibrium to the extent that
    mating is assortatative.  
        
     If we are considering rare alleles we can make the
    following approximations allowing us to avoid a lot of messy algebra
    in our calculations.  
                  
     For f(**a**) = **q**, and f(**A**) = **p**,  if  p+q=1
    then **p**=1-q  
     From **H-W**: f(**A/A**) = **p**<sup>2 </sup>, f(**a/A**) = 2**pq
    and**  f(**a/a**) = **q**<sup>2 </sup>

     Instructions: In this lecture (27) you will examine how inbreeding
    between close relatives (also known as consanguineous matings)
    influences the appearance of autosomal recessive traits. Note that
    inbreeding will not make a difference for dominant traits because
    they need only be inherited from one parent or for X-linked traits
    since they are inherited from the mother. In population genetics,
    inbreeding will lead to the decrease of the requency of
    heterozygotes and increase of the frequency of homozygotes.

**1.2.4 Genetic Drift** <span id="1.2.4"></span> 
*Genetic drift is one of the common mechanisms of evolution, since the
violation of the Hardy-Weinberg rule on the large population size is
often found in nature. When population size decreases, the rate of
evolution by the genetic drift is expected to be higher. Drift can lead
to the loss or a fixation of an allele, regardless of the other factors
of evolution. In nature, drift often happens if a population suffers a
great loss of individuals (bottleneck effect) or when a new population
is founded by a random small sample of individuals (founder effect). In
the reading below we will examine both of these cases.*

     Instructions: This activity/tutorial demonstrates how speciation
    can occur in a species of frog over time. This will also test your
    understanding of three different species concepts.  
      
     Note: The divergence of one species into two or more species will
    typically begin with some type of population isolation. Perhaps, a
    geographical barrier arises, cutting a portion of the population off
    from the rest. Or spatial differences in the availability of
    resources cause radical changes in foraging habits for a portion of
    the population, which in turn affects timing and availability for
    mating. Here, we will discuss population-isolating mechanisms, as
    well as how events of population isolation and reunification might
    affect the process of speciation.

**1.3.1 Isolating Mechanisms** <span id="1.3.1"></span> 
*The isolating mechanisms are essential in speciation. To understand
this we must start with the biological definition of species by E. Mayr
(1942):  
  
 "Species are groups of actually or potentially interbreeding
populations, which are reproductively isolated from other such
groups."  
  
 Ernst Mayr's formulation of the biological species concept is one of
the widely accepted concepts of species, yet it cannot be applied to all
living organisms (e.g. asexual species). There are several types of
isolating mechanisms and they are usually classified in two large
categories: the prezygotic isolating mechanisms that prevent actual
fertilization or the formation of a zygote, and the postzygotic
isolating mechanisms (those that prevent prolonged existence of the
hybrid zygotes, juveniles or adults).*  
  
 *A) **Pre-zygotic isolating mechanisms**- prevent union of gametes -\>
zygote*  
  
 *1. Mates do not meet (seasonal, temporal or habitat isolation)  
  
 2. Mates meet but do not mate (ethological or behavioral isolation)  
  
 3. Mates meet but no sperm transfer (mechanical isolation)  
  
 4. Sperm dies before fertilization (chemical isolation) etc.*  
  
 B) **Post-zygotic isolating mechanisms**- varying degrees of hybrid
mortality and/or sterility  
  
 *1. Zygote dies  
  
 2. Zygote produces an F1 adult that has reduced viability (survival)  
  
 3. Hybrid is viable, but partially or completely sterile (fecundity)
or the F2 is deficient.  
  
 Species might simultaneously possess both types of
isolating mechanisms.  
  
 As we will see below, the biological species concept begins to break
down in some cases. For example at hybrid zones, the somewhat
differentiated populations are in the process of speciation. An organism
that mates with a different semi-species might produce low viability
offspring (in any of the degrees listed above). This phenomenon is often
called the hybrid breakdown and it occurs when F1 generation mating
produces too many incompatible gene combinations.  
  
 Genetic similarity drops as we change from the different levels of
differentiation, going up the hierarchy: Populations -
Subspecies - Semispecies - Sibling species - non-sibling species -
species.  
  
 As genetic similarity drops, the differences increase and
the possibility of hybrid breakdown increases. A species is thought
to have a coadapted genome in which many genes are finely tuned by the
proper interactions with other genes. Genetic differentiation occurs
during speciation but it is not always sufficient to define a new
species.*

     Instructions: This video presentation will provide a basic
    understanding of the coevolution including examples and terminology.
    Be sure to take notes and pay particular attention to all the terms
    the presenter introduces.  
        
     Note: Coevolution is concurrent change in two (or more) species, in
    response to pressures exerted by the other species. It can occur
    within the context of any close relationship between species. For
    example, a prey species may evolve physically and behaviorally to
    better blend in with the environment in order to avoid predation.
    The predator species might then coevolve better eyesight, stalking
    behavior, or methods of flushing the prey, in order to continue to
    eat. Species that compete for the same resources also coevolve,
    either through niche partitioning (where each species becomes more
    specialized in resource use, so that the resources are basically
    divided) or in other ways where one species takes better advantage
    of the available resources than its competitor. Here, we will
    discuss a few theories regarding how and why coevolution occurs.
