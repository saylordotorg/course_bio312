**Unit 2: Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium** <span id="2"></span> 
*At this point in your biology studies, you should be familiar with the
Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium. You might even know how it’s calculated. But
how is it really used in the field? What does it measure?  
  
 In this unit, we will learn the practical uses for Hardy-Weinberg
Equilibrium calculations. We will then practice using these calculations
in hypothetical situations, as well as in order to determine whether the
population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Your activity in this unit
will involve an assignment or simulation in which you will be required
to calculate the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium and use it to make
predictions or draw conclusions.*

**Unit 2 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take you approximately 5.5 hours.

**Unit2 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:  
-   calculate the allele and genotypic frequencies based on the concepts
    of Hardy-Weinberg  Equilibrium; and
-   use Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium to determine whether a population is
    evolving.

**2.1.1 Baseline Measure for Genetic Change** <span id="2.1.1"></span> 
*Note: Before we can predict whether a selective pressure can cause a
change in the allele frequency in a population, we first need to
understand how the allele will behave in the absence of the  selective
pressure. This subunit is covered by the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology reading on Population Genetics assigned just beneath subunit
2.1.*

**2.1.2 Predict Allele or Genotype Frequencies** <span
id="2.1.2"></span> 
*Note: Within a population, it is important to know whether a particular
allele will become more or less common over time. This subunit is
covered by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology reading on
Population Genetics assigned just beneath subunit 2.1.*

**2.2.1 Predicting Allele Frequencies in a Population** <span
id="2.2.1"></span> 
*Note: For a population with random mating, the frequency of alleles in
the gene pool can be calculated from the genotypic frequencies. If there
are two alleles at a specific locus, allele one (A<sub>1</sub>) and
 allele two (A<sub>2</sub>), and the frequency of A<sub>1</sub> is p,
while the frequency of  A<sub>2</sub> in the gene pool is q. If A1 and
A2 are the only alleles of the gene A in that population, then (p + q =
1). This is covered in the reading in Section 2.2.*

**2.2.2 Predicting Genotype Frequencies in a Population** <span
id="2.2.2"></span> 
*Note: With random mating in a population, we can predict the frequency
of zygotes produced in a hypothetical life cycle  (generation) and
calculate the frequencies of the genotypes in the next generation. The
frequency of the homozygous dominant genotype
(A<sub>1</sub>A<sub>1</sub>) in the population can be calculated as
p<sup>2</sup>. The frequency of the heterozygous genotype
(A<sub>1</sub>A<sub>2</sub>) in the population can be calculated as 2pq.
The frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype
(A<sub>2</sub>A<sub>2</sub>) in the population can be calculated
as q<sup>2</sup>. Thus, for the entire population under random mating
(p + q)<sup>2</sup> =1, the genotypic frequencies are calculated as:
p<sup>2</sup> + 2pq + q<sup>2</sup>=1. This is covered in the reading in
Section 2.2.*

that evolution is occurring. This is covered in the reading in Section
2.2.*

     Instructions: As you read this article, take a note of
    the different factors that can affect allele frequencies, and
    the equations you can use to test if the population is evolving and
    which factor(s) of evolution might be affecting the population. Keep
    in mind when you are looking for evolutionary change in a population
    that it may not be present at every (or any) locus you test. Some
    loci may show change while others do not.

     Instructions: Using the population data provided, you will
    calculate allele frequencies (at a specific locus, for a genetic
    characteristic) and determine whether the population is in
    Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium. Based on your calculations, you should
    be able to discern whether or not the population is evolving. You
    should also be able to make some conjectures about the driving force
    behind the evolutionary change. After completing the assessment, you
    should be able to address each of the points below and come up
    with some ideas concerning effective management techniques, based
    upon the specified goals below:  

    -   Discovering evolutionary changes
    -   Managing directional selection in a population
    -   Managing genetic diversity in a population

    When you are finished, you can check your answers against this

    Key](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/BIO312-Assessment-1-Answers-FINAL.pdf).

     Instructions: Read the introduction and work on the Lab 1 Part 1,
    and Lab 1 Part 2 problems. These modules teach you how population
    geneticists study frequencies of genotypes and alleles within
    populations. You will compare the observed frequencies with those
    predicted by the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium, as a null model that
    assumes no evolutionary change. Selection, Mutation, Migration and
    Genetic Drift are mathematical violations of the H-W equilibrium and
    thus, mechanisms of evolution.
